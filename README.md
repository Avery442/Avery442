## Introduction

I like to make games, software and backends. I'm a female (Transgender Male To Female or MTF). I enjoy programming games that interest me. I also enjoy learning new things and developing tech demos out of them.

## Strong Points

I'm strong at making versitile backends for tasks that are out of the ordinary. (Cookly - The AI Recipe Crafter)[https://github.com/Avery442/Cookly] is an example of a project where I put two ideas together and created a basic backend but one that is strong at what it does.

## Weaknesses

I'm typically prone to get burnt out a lot and struggle to keep up with projects that bore me a bit.
